## How to get help

We use GitHub for tracking bugs and feature requests. This isn't the right place to get support for using this project, but the following resources are available:

### Documentation
- Check the [documentation](docs/) directory
- Read through our [Wiki](../../wiki) if available
- Look for example code in the [examples](examples/) directory if available

### Questions
1. **Search existing issues and discussions** - someone might have asked the same question before.
2. **Stack Overflow** - Ask questions using the appropriate tags.
3. **Community Forums** - [IF APPLICABLE, ADD FORUM LINKS]

Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests or consulting questions.
